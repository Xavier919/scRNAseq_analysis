# scRNAseq_analysis

This repository contains tools and scripts for analyzing single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data.

## Project Structure

- `modules/`: Contains modular scripts and functions for various analysis tasks
- `sc_env/`: Environment setup for single-cell analysis
- `DGEA.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook for Differential Gene Expression Analysis
- `EDA.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook for Exploratory Data Analysis
- `compositional_analysis.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook for compositional analysis of scRNA-seq data
- `requirements.txt`: List of required Python packages

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository
2. Set up the environment using the `sc_env/` directory
3. Install required packages:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Analysis Workflows

This project includes several Jupyter notebooks for different aspects of scRNA-seq analysis:

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Use `EDA.ipynb` to perform initial data exploration and visualization.
- **Differential Gene Expression Analysis (DGEA)**: `DGEA.ipynb` contains workflows for identifying differentially expressed genes between cell populations.
- **Compositional Analysis**: `compositional_analysis.ipynb` provides methods for analyzing the compositional nature of scRNA-seq data.

## Modules

The `modules/` directory contains reusable functions and scripts to support various analysis tasks. Refer to the individual module documentation for usage details.
